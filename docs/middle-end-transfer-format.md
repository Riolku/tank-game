# Middle-end transfer format

This document will detail the format in which data will be stored while it is being transferred from the back-end to the front-end for the replay viewer. The format should be provided as a regular JSON object.

## Sample File

```json
[
  [
    [["x1", "y1"], ["x2", "y2"], ["x3", "y3"], ["x4", "y4"]]
  ],
  ["player-1", "player-2"],
  [
    ["class", "..."],
    ["..."]
  ],
  [
    [
      [
        ["x", "y", "HP", "shield", "firing angle (or -1)", "ability cooldown (or -1 to currently use)"],
        "..."
      ],
      ["..."]
    ]
  ]
]
```
