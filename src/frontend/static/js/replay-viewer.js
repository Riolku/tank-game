      now we need to precompute all of the frames (because otherwise jumping/skipping will be qutie expensive)

      we need to consider the following things:
      - tank movement
      - tank abilities
      - explosion effects taking up multiple frames
      - target reticle from mortar
      - barrier and tank HP
      - cooldown display

      we need to store the following things at each frame:
      - tank positions
      - tank rotations
      - tank state (affected by abilities)
      - temporary display affects and transparency
